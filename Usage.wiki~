#summary Instructions how to use the GWT Cropper plugin
#labels Featured,Phase-Implementation

= Introduction =

The plugin is pretty simple and it has only necessary functionality.


= Details =

You can create an instance of the plugin in this way:
{{{
   final GWTCropper cropper = new GWTCropper("path/to/your/uncropped/image.jpg");
   panel.add(cropper);
}}}

==Set the aspect ratio==

*public void setAspectRatio(float acpectRatio)*

Sets the aspect ratio (proportion of width to height) for the selection.

Examples:

    * default is 0, it means, that the selection can have any shape.
    * ratio is 1/1=1, then the selection will be square.
    * ratio 2/1=2, then the selection will be rectangular where width is twice longer than height
    * ratio 1/2=0.5, then the selection will be rectangular where height is twice higher than width

_Usage example: You can declare a side proportion in this way:_
{{{
 cropper.setAspectRatio( (float) 1/2); 
}}}

= Initialize widget using UiBuilder =
_(since v. 0.5.0)_

You can initialize the GWT-Cropper either in Java code or in XML view as well. To add the widget to a _.ui.xml_ file, please use this code example:

{{{
<ui:UiBinder xmlns:ui='urn:ui:com.google.gwt.uibinder'
     xmlns:g='urn:import:com.google.gwt.user.client.ui'
     xmlns:my="urn:import:com.google.code.gwt.crop.client">

     <my:GWTCropper  ui:field="cropper" aspectRatio="1.5" imageURL="url/to/your/uncropped/image.jpg" />
}}}

Please notice, that the _imageUrl_ is mandatory parameter, but the _aspectRatio_ is optional (default value is 0, that means that a selection might have any shape).

==How to harvest selection coordinates==

When you are done, you can retrieve the result coordinates of the selection. Let's say, you placed a button "Crop" near the cropper and you assigned the click handler on it. Then, inside this handler you can use next methods to yield actual information about selection:

    * cropper.getSelectionXCoordinate()
    * cropper.getSelectionYCoordinate()
    * cropper.getSelectionWidth() 
    * cropper.getSelectionHeight() 

To understand the public API methods, please refer to the diagram below:
